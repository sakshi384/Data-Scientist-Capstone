* PySpark

### Project Description & Motivation: <a name="motivation"></a>
In this project, the objective is to make use of the big data and distributed computing nature of Spark to explore and understand the Sparkify dataset provided, and use machine learning APIs from Spark ML to build and tune models to predict the churn rate of Sparkify. Sparkify is a fictional music streaming service similar to Spotify, and the dataset used in this project is mainly activity logs from each user which would be useful for predicting the churn rate of Sparkify.

### File Description: <a name="files"></a>
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to this project. The notebook is exploratory in searching through and working with the data pertaining to the churn rate prediction of the subject in hand, and markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>
All the finding and conclusion can be check in the ```Sparkify.ipynb``` file.
